#### Merchant blocked by cardholder status
A _merchant blocked by cardholder_ status code is both a decline of the current authorization, but also a notice to **halt all future merchant-initiated-transactions** on this card from this merchant. This includes, but is not limited to, recurring transactions.

Only after the blockade has been lifted, by actions taken by the cardholder, may transactions be resumed.
