#### Debit refunds
To refund money to a cardholder's bank account that has been transferred by a debit you make a new refund resource. Only a single refund can be made for a debit and it can only be for the full amount.

```shell
POST https://gateway.clearhaus.com/debits/:id/refunds
```

##### Parameters
No parameters are needed to make a new refund transaction.

{{% notice %}}
**Notice**: In almost all cases, an approved debit is eventually cleared by Visa and the issuer. It should be noted that Visa or the issuer might decline a debit refund with the reasoning that 24 hours have passed since the debit or that the debit has cleared. There is no dedicated signaling for this, so the transaction gateway has no dedicated status code. We recommend that a debit refund is created as soon as possible, in case a debit needs to be refunded.
