## Series of transactions
Clearhaus supports two types of subscription billing:

  - Recurring: Transactions processed at agreed, predetermined, regular intervals not exceeding 1 year; e.g. a monthly subscription for a magazine.
  - Unscheduled (UCOF, Unscheduled Credential on File): Transactions not occurring on predetermined, regular intervals; e.g. a car sharing subscription billed weekly but only for weeks when the service is used.

For both types, there may be an agreed end of the series and the amount may be varying. See the partner guideline for more details.
